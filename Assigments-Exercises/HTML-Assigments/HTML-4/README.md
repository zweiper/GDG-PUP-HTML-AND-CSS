   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
       <title>Favorites List</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <!-- Enter Your Code Here -->
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

### Step 3: Add the Unordered List 📝

</ol>
```

2. Replace `Step 1`, `Step 2`, and `Step 3` with actual steps to start your hobby.
